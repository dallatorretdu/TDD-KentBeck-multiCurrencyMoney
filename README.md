# TDD-KentBeck-multiCurrencyMoney
TDD exercise based on beck's book, without following his steps after chapter 10

As soon I started reading the booke TDD By Example by kent beck I felt like I would follow his exercise on my eclipse.
As this is not my first TDD reading and exercise I felt like I could sail along my own tests after passing chapter 10.
Then I would compare the 2 solutions reading the chapters.
